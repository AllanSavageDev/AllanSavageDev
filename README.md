# Allan Savage

### AWS Cloud Engineer | Terraform Specialist | Serverless Developer

I design and deploy full AWS serverless environments from scratch using Terraform and Python.  
My recent work focuses on private-only VPC architectures, Lambda APIs, RDS/DynamoDB integrations, and CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions.  
Comfortable across the full stack — Terraform, AWS, Python, and Node — I build systems that are reliable, modular, and easy to maintain.
